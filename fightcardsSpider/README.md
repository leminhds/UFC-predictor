# Scraping UFC fighters statistic

#todo: expain what the heck is this thing

#todo: explain what data did we scrape

## Getting started

If you want to scrape again from scratch to get the latest fighters' data, 

First, make sure you have scrapy (I would recommend that you create a separate environment before running the following command):
```bash
pip isntall scrapy
```


after Cloning the project, cd to fightcardsSpider/fightcards/spiders. Then, from the Command Lines, run:

```bash
scrapy runspider cardsSpider.py
```

or if you want to generate a csv file directly after scraping, run the following command, it will create a csv file with the name "fighters.csv" in the same folder:
```bash
scrapy runspider cardsSpider.py -o fighters.csv -t csv
```

and that's it!

```python
    card_name = Field()
    fight_date = Field()
